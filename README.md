# All-About-Me
Building out a basic three page website 

As part of my homework I wanted to dig into not only grids and bootstrap but the overall look of a webpage. Playing with typography and backgrounds to build a theme that represents me.

The photos I pulled for the portfolio are of my favorite places from the mountains and beaches of North Carolina; the state that I group up in.

I took each of the bootstrap elements I used and then personalized them so they fit with the overall look I was trying to achieve while still remaining responsive across platforms.
