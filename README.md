# About Rachel Wanke
Building out a basic three page website 

As part of my homework I wanted to dig into not only grids and bootstrap but the overall look of a webpage. Playing with typography and backgrounds to build a theme that represents me.

The photos I pulled for the portfolio are of my favorite places from the mountains and beaches of North Carolina; the state that I group up in.

I took each of the bootstrap elements I used and then personalized them so they fit with the overall look I was trying to achieve while still remaining responsive across platforms. 

Website colors were picked based on complimentary colors and looking at a color picker to see what went best together for an eye pleasing page. Add background images for extra flare.

Links were added to social media on the about me page to send the user to important pages that display my work, such as Pinterest (mood boards) and GitHub (portfolio of websites). My LinkedIN was added for adding in my resume, as well as facebook to see a bit more about me or possibly link it to a Facebook Page in the future.
