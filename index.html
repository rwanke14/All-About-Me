          Rachel Wanke is an asipring web developer who has worked in the Washington, DC area for the past six
          years as an adminstrative profession. As an admin professional she has built a solid foundation for
          problem solivng, which she applies to learning code and visual design. There is never a problem that is
          too big to solve! As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, "Nothing has ever been achieved by the person who says,
          'It can't be done.'"

          Rachel is currently taking a course with the George Washingon University to build on her coding skills
          so she can change careers. After having her son in 2018, she realized she wasn't doing what she loved and
          if she was challenge of a career in web development. When she first began her current job in fundraising,
          she had no idea what she was doing, but thanks to her strong skill of learning quickly on the go she got the
          hang of it in under a year. She went from just scheduling to helping build out donor experiences. She
          intends to do the same with web development!</p>
